# Emulation-of-a-ternary-computer
Attempt to construct a device that can use the ternary number system. Needs to be run in 3.10 because "logic.py" uses switch...case statements. Program code is written into "DataInstructions.ter" and applied to "memory.ter" and as a result the code is static for the moment until I add a CLI for editing 'on-the-fly'. Read the comments in the code. I've included a repl folder for if you want to import the files directly into www.repl.it
