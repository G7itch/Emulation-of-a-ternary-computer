# Emulation-of-a-ternary-computer
Attempt to construct a device that can use the ternary number system. Program code is written into "DataInstructions.ter" and applied to "memory.ter". Read the comments in the code. I've included a repl folder for if you want to import the files directly into www.repl.it - WARNING, logic.py uses switch...case statements so if you intend to use that file then you need to run it in 3.10, at the moment the main code doesnt actually use it so this isnt a worry for general use
